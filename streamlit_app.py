# Types:

## Text Replacement:
Rows without a specified "type" or with the "word" type will be treated as text replacements when followed by a space.

Example: Typing "kala " (with a space) will produce 🐟.

## Letter:
The "letter" type converts the typed key regardless of what comes before or after it.

Example: Typing "a" (no space) anywhere will produce 🅰.
            
#### Unicode: You can use U+ unicode point notation.
Example: "tenpo " (with space) will produce ⏰.
            
#### Menus:
To bring up a menu after typing something, add a single digit number after the word.

Example: "pona1" will bring up a menu with 👍 and 🙂 as options.

## Important Note:
Keep in mind that later rules can override earlier rules.
For example, if you have a rule to replace "a" with "🅰", then "kala " will no longer produce 🐟 because the "a" will be replaced first, resulting in "k🅰l🅰 ".""")
